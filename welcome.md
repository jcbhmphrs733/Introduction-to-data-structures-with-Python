# Welcome to Intro to Data Structures with Python
My name is Jacob Humphreys and I am a student at BYU Idaho. This repository is my final project for my *programming with data structures* class. Here, you can learn about three basic data structures and how to implement them with Python. Each data structure will be accompanied with a small lesson and demonstration problems that we both solve together and on your own.

## Why data structures?
Computers can compute very large amounts of data in very small amounts of time. However, it is still important to think carefully about both where and how a computer stores or retrieves the information that we are interested in. Just as you would not walk to the store for a single apple, return home and then immedeatly head back to the store for a loaf of bread, we must first identify what we want to do and then be as effeciant as possible when retrieving or storing information on computers. Data Structures help us accomplish this. Here are three important structures to understand.
